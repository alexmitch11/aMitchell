 <h1> Welcome to Alex's Programming page   
     <p> My name is Alex Mithchell and this is the site I will be utilizing for CSC106 at The University of Rhode Island
         I am currently a Sophomore living on campus, I am from Central Connecticut and enjoy watching the Lakers and UFC. </p>
     
     <br></br>
        <p> I enjoy the summer most due to the fact I dont really know how to ski or do any winter activities so I just suffer in the cold </p>
