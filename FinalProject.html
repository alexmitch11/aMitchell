   <h1> Welcome to My Final Project </h1>
        <p> In this game it is going to be a paint by number. Youre going to start on a main screen and you have the choice to choose the object 
            you would like to paint first. If you mess up or want to restart click reset and things will restart, to pick a color when on a picture click the color corresponding to the number area then drag the mouse after in order to color. </p>
    <br></br>
    
    <p>What is also great about this game is, although you may be limited to a few colors, you can do as you please with them meaning you can make your car completely blue. Get Creative with it and Have Fun! </p>
